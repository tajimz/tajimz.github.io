    "body": "In 2026, sustainable design is shaping the architecture of the future.\n\nMinimalist principles reduce material waste, while renewable materials like cross-laminated timber and recycled steel become standard in urban construction. Cities are increasingly incorporating green roofs, solar facades, and passive building systems to cut energy consumption.\n\nEco-friendly skyscrapers integrate vertical gardens, solar panels, and wind turbines to improve air quality and urban biodiversity. Zero-waste residential complexes use modular components that can be easily recycled or repurposed. Urban planners emphasize climate resilience, making sustainability a central focus of both private and public infrastructure projects.",
